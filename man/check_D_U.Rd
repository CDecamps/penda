\usage{
check_D_U(D_U_ctrl, ctrl_data, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{D_U_ctrl}{The list of the two matrix D and U for each genes}

\item{ctrl_data}{The matrix of gene expression used to make D and U matrix}

\item{threshold}{The threshold used to make D and U matrix. It's the proportion of genes that
must meet the conditions}
}
\value{
This function returns an error message if D or U list don't mette the conditions. In normal case, the function return "OK" message.
}
\description{
This function check if not exists genes both up and down expressed, and for each gene :
if the maximal down gene is less expressed in threshold% of cases,
if the minimal up gene is more expressed in threshold % of cases.
}
